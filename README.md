## Problem Statement :~

According to The Times of India just during April over 37,000 receipts(challans) were issued in Delhi for speeding and thatâ€™s when the traffic is quite low due to lockdown and this irresponsible driving behaviour is one of the reasons India has the 7th highest accident rates. 

## Solution To This :~

People often have an incentive to drive fast but not so much to follow traffic rules instead just fear, we want to change that by rewarding them for following traffic rules and driving responsibly.
